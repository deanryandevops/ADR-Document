# Architecture Decision Record (ADR) - 

## Title:

Decision on what CI/CD tool for project-management project

## Created By:

Dean Ryan

## Date:

05/03/2025

## Decision Maker:

Dean Ryan

## Stakeholders:

Pauric Dawson

## Status: 

Accepted as discussed with the team

## Context: 

So a few CI/CD tools were considered and spiked, examples being Team City and GitHub Actions but I felt Jenkins for this process was best suited

## Decision: 

Jenkins was decided for a number of reasons, open source, well maintained, an array of maintained plugins, full control, experience with using the tool and the understanding that the task needed could be 
achieved in Jenkins.

## Consequences: 

Not everyone had used Jenkins in the team so would be upskill needed to facilate if tasks overlapped.
Prior knowledge is needed to really understand how it works and what it can achieve.
